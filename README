This is the ml project. It's a clone of the ci-bayes project, and
is identical in codebase, although development is expected to proceed.

The ml project is designed to implement a range of machine learning
algorithms, primarily focusing on classification. The initial codebase
is aimed at providing bayes classification, with other types of
classification engines following.
